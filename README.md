# 🥗 NutriGenie – AI-Powered Personalized Nutrition Assistant

An intelligent AI assistant that generates personalized meal plans based on user goals, dietary preferences, allergies, and health conditions. Built using **IBM Watsonx.ai** and **IBM Granite**, NutriGenie provides smart, real-time nutrition advice that adapts through feedback. It supports voice, text, and image inputs, making healthy eating accessible to all.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Most nutrition apps offer generic diets and fail to consider personal factors like cultural preferences, allergies, or medical needs. This leads to ineffective or even harmful food recommendations, especially for users managing health conditions like diabetes, obesity, or hypertension.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

NutriGenie is an AI-powered agent built with IBM Watsonx.ai and IBM Granite LLM that generates meal plans personalized to user inputs. It leverages natural language understanding and dynamic prompting to provide adaptive, easy-to-understand nutrition guidance. With multimodal input and a feedback loop, it behaves like a virtual dietitian — smart, human-like, and responsive.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User enters a request like:  
   _“Create a 1500-calorie high-protein meal plan for a vegetarian with diabetes”_  
2. IBM Watson NLP processes intent and data  
3. IBM Granite LLM generates a smart, tailored meal plan  
4. Optional feedback is saved (e.g., dislikes, allergies)  
5. Nutrition data is visualized and adjusted over time
